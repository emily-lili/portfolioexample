<p> Hello, my name is Emily Li and this is a little about me. I am from Seattle, I promise it doesn't rain here as often as you think. For my education background, I have a bachelors in business administration. 
    Thought i'd be done with school, but decided to try Coding Temple so I can add it to my skillset. It doesnt hurt to learn a something new. On my free time I love to binge watch netflix documenteries. Currently watching a show called Manifest. 
    Some quarentine hobbies ive picked up this are, puzzle building, fishing and snowboarding. I flew back from Alaska recently from a salmon fishing trip. It was an underwhelming trip, we were very unsuccessful with catching salmon, but we caught a few smaller fishes. 
    Another hobby of mine is snowboarding. I learned how to snowboard last March, was lots of fun being able to go out and snowboard this season.
